# My works of Machine Learning

## Text classification with catboost and fastText
Binary classification problem: to determine if there is contact information in the advertisement.

## Hierarchical classification
A lot of new products arrive in the marketplace every day and each of them must be assigned to a specific category in the category tree (there are more than 1000 categories). It takes a lot of effort and time, so I want to learn how to predict a category based on short description and parameters of products.

**Technical description:**
1. Approaches: Local Classifier per Node (LCN) and Local Classifier per Parent Node (LCPN);
2. Base model: Random Forest;
3. Dataset: 354316 instances;
4. Libraries: hiclass, scikit-learn, networkx.

## Person segmentation service
This is my instance segmentation service person class basen on MaskRCNN model.

**Technical description:**
1. Model: MaskRCNN based on resnet101 and pretrained on COCO-2017 dataset;
3. Library: gluoncv;
4. Web framework: FastAPI;
5. Cloud service: Google Cloud Platform.
