## Car price prediction. Case 2
To identify cars whose price is below market, we should predict their price by characteristics, description and image. Dataset consists of tabular data (6682 rows into train set and 1671 rows into test set) and images.

## Image classification
Pretrained EfficientNet model to classify car model by image. Dataset consists of 15561 images into train set and 6675 images into test set.

## George image classification
Classification of Saint George the Victorious by image.

## Recommender system
Collaborative filtering model to predict goods rating for user-item pairs. Dataset consists of 857895 rows into train set and 285965 rows into test set.

## Car price prediction. Case 1
To identify cars whose price is below market, we should predict their price by characteristics. There is no training sample with correct answers. It must be found from external sources. The model is a stack of RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor with LinearRegressor meta-model.

## Credit scoring problem
Logistic regression model to predict customer default.

## Restaurant rating prediction
Random forest model to predict restaurant rating.

## Exploratory data analysis
Exploratory data analysis of the dataset.  To track the impact of the living conditions of schoolchildren aged 15 to 22 on their math performance to identify students at risk at an early stage.
